2. Data, which shows the cleaned data as well as providing links to the original datasets
3. E-Government Index visualizations, which show the shape of the index in 2014, 2016, and the change over time.
4. OpenData Barometer visualizations, which show the shape of the rankings in 2014, 2016, and the change over time.
5. A comparative visualization which graphs the two indexes together in 2014 and 2016 and displays the statistically significant pvalue as well as a linear regression.
